Description: This package contains functions to assist with portfolio backtests in R. 
    Many functions are modified from the Systematic Investor Toolbox (SIT) for compatability
    with Standard & Poor's Compustat database. These functions are to be used alongside SIT
    functions, mainly for multiple-factor backtesting.
